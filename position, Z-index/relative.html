      Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a
      relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its
      normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap
      left by the element.
    </p>
    <div class="relative">Relative</div>
    <p>
      An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it
      is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    </p>
