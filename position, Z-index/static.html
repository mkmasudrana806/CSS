    <p>
      HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements
      are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    </p>
    <div class="static">static</div>
    <p>
      An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it
      is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
